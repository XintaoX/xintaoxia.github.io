I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.iastate.edu) at Iowa State University starting from 2019. I am advised by Professor [Wayne Fuller](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/people/wayne-fuller) and Professor [Zhanrui Cai](https://zhanruicai.github.io/). Before graduate school, I received my Bachelor degrees in Physics and Mathematics from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2019.

My reseach interest contains survey sampling, selective inference, causal inference, high-dimensional inference and differential privacy.
